# Farever Item Utilities

A collection of inventory, bank, equipment, and item-safety quality-of-life tools for Farever.

## Features

### Bank deposit shortcuts

Adds six deposit buttons beside the bank's Sort button:

- **Deposit all**
- **Deposit crafting materials**
- **Deposit food**
- **Deposit consumables**
- **Deposit demon enchantments**
- **Deposit miscellaneous items**

The deposit buttons can be hidden from the mod settings.

### Recycler deposit shortcut

Adds a **Deposit all** button beside the Spark Recycler's Sort button. It moves
every eligible unlocked item into the Recycler, skips locked or rejected items,
and stops when the Recycler is full or no eligible items remain.

### Item locking

Adds an item-locking mode beside the character inventory's Sort button. Enable locking mode and click inventory items to lock or unlock them.

Locked items are marked with a small lock icon and are protected from:

- Selling
- Dropping or discarding
- Depositing into the bank
- Placing into the Spark Recycler

Locks follow items as they move between inventory and equipment. They are persisted separately for each character using Farever's unique character ID, with item identity and location tracking to avoid transferring a lock to the wrong identical item.

Locking visuals can be hidden without disabling or deleting saved locks. The settings menu also includes a separately confirmed **Delete all saved locks** action.

An optional **Sorting ignores locked items (but is slower)** setting keeps
every locked item in its exact inventory slot while sorting the unlocked items
around it.

### Weapon presets

Adds three weapon preset buttons and a **Set** button beside **Appearance** on the Character Profile page.

- Preset 1 is selected by default for a new character.
- Select a preset and press **Set** to save the currently equipped weapons.
- Pressing a configured preset immediately equips its saved weapons from the character inventory.
- Activating an unset preset does nothing.
- If one or more saved weapons are missing, available weapons are still equipped and missing entries are skipped safely.
- Presets and the currently selected preset are persisted separately for each character.

Each preset can also be assigned its own configurable keyboard shortcut, including Ctrl, Shift, Alt, or Windows-key combinations. Preset hotkeys work without opening the Character Profile page.

### Settings

Press **F9 (default)** to open the settings menu. The settings hotkey is configurable.

Available settings include:

- Enable or disable Item Utilities
- Show or hide bank and Recycler deposit buttons
- Show or hide item-locking visuals
- Keep locked items in their exact slots while sorting
- Delete all saved locks
- Configure or clear hotkeys for weapon presets 1–3
- Change the settings-menu hotkey
